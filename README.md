# PowerConnectFour
Connect Four is a game where players win by placing four of their
pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The board is a vertical plane with a limited number of
columns; playing a piece in a column will drop to the lowest available space. Players take turns dropping pieces into
columns, trying to get four in a row before their opponent does. In this project, we will implement a Power Connect Four
game and hence follow slightly revised rules as detailed below.

There are three major components to this project:
1. Implementing one the most fundamental data structures in computer science (the
dynamic array list).
2. Using this data structure to implement a larger program.
3. Practicing many fundamental skills learned in prior programming courses including
generic classes.
